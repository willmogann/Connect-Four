# Connect Four

I loved playing the two-player game Connect Four as a child and want you to write a Java implementation of the game. With the game, there is an 8x8 vertical grid on which players take turns placing their pieces. The goal of the game is to have four of your game pieces connected---in a row, column, or diagonally. When a player places a piece in a column, the piece will  land in the bottom-most available row (see example below). 

In the following 4x4 grid, if I were to add a piece to the first column, it would land in the bottom row since nothing else is in the column. If I were to add a piece to the second column, it would land in the second row from the bottom on top of the ‘O’ since it is the bottom-most available row.

| **-** | **-** | **-** | **-** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **-** | **-** | **-** | **-** |
| **-** | **O** | **-** | **-** |
| **-** | **X** | **-** | **-** |


As the players play the game, they should be updated with how many pieces they have placed and the max number of connected game pieces they currently have (this will be less than four until the game is won).

## Update

I want to improve the game by enlarging the grid and number of pieces that must be connected. The user should be able to set the number of pieces that must be connected (greater than four). The grid size should adjust to the number of required pieces such that it is always double the number of required pieces. For example, if required number of pieces connected is 6, then the grid is 12x12. Stats for players should be kept such that the two players can play multiple games and they can see how many games each player has won.
